        <h1>How Chords Work</h1>
        <h2>
            What's a chord?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Although it may surpise many of you, there are really only seven notes to a scale (eight if you count the next octive of your mother tone).  A chord is composed of more than one note played in harmony.  Power chords or rock chords are usually only composed of two notes (and are generally not considered full chords).  Normally three or more tones are used to make a chord.  For example, the chord of C, is composed of the notes C, E, and G in three part harmony. <br><br>
            
        </p>
        <h2>
                But why???
        </h2>
        <p>
            A great question!  One with no simple solution without delving into a great deal of music theory.  Instead, I will offer you an introduction to the ideas that guide three and four part harmonies, based out of the key of C.


        </p>
        <h2>
            The Key of C?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The key of C is composed of the notes C-B (or C-C if you want to be that guy/gal).  Just follow the alphabet up to G and start over if you don't know what note comes next.  If you can remember A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, you are in a pretty good position for understanding music.
            If you think of the notes each as a number from 1-7 you will also be in a good position to discuss jazz.
        </p>
        <h2>
            That's great and all, buuuut you still didn't tell me how to build a chord!
        </h2>
        <p>
            Doh! My bad!  Chords are built (traditonally) by skipping an interval in the scale.  In the case of major chords (like what you hear in country and folk music) these chords are constructed by taking your current position of the scale (your mother tone which we will refer to as your "one"), then skipping a note (skipping the "two"), playing the third note (the three), skipping the fourth note (the four), and playing the fifth note (the five).  It is easier to say a chord (in three part harmony) is composed of a 1 3 and 5.

        </p>
         <h2>
            But what about the sad sounding chords!?
        </h2>
         <p>
           You are probably thinking of minor chords.  We have to get a bit more advanced here, so if you gloss over, I apologize.  In terms of the scale you are in, they are composed of the same principle of 1 3 and 5.  However, the interval distance between the notes actually changes on the instrument (due to flats and sharps), so the quality of the chord changes.  Normally a major chord is composed of taking two steps (to get to the three), and then one and a half steps to get to the 5.  In minor chords, it only takes one and a half steps to get to the three, and then two steps to get to the 5.  Often times it is easier to say a minor chord has a flatted 3rd.

        <p>
           Don't freak out, because you don't need to know that to impress your friends on the piano.  Next time you are on a piano, just remeber to stick on the white keys, and follow the above advice, and you will totally sound fine (in theory).
